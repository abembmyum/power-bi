# Analyzing Customer Churn 

For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, you'll investigate a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates.

Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. 

A good definition is the one from Investopedia: "The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity." Compare churn with the leaky bucket problem. We can fill the bucket with more water (or new customers in this case), but the overall revenue won't increase if existing customers are leaving the company. It's easier to retain customers than to attract new customers, so for many companies it's a priority to reduce churn.

The simplified formula for churn is to divide customers lost by the total number of customers. If we have a total of 100 customers in a certain period, and 10 end up leaving, we have a churn rate of 10%. There are multiple methods to calculate churn, and depending on the industry, it might make sense for a company to slightly alter the formula. A traditional e-commerce platform might consider a certain customer a churner if he or she hasn't made a purchase in the last 12 months.
